Simple jMonkeyEngine 3 Demo
===========================

It features scene loading, animated model loading, lighting and shadows and simple AI control.

To run the demo you need to download [town.zip](https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/wiki/raw/master/src/docs/resources/Scenes/Town/town.zip)
and put it into root project directory (the same level as `src` directory).
